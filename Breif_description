# //ABOUT THE PROJECT//
#One of the interesting aspects about blood is that it is not a typical commodity. First, there i sthe perishable nature of blood. Grocery stores face the dilemma of perishable products such as milk, which can be challenging to predict accurately so as to not lose sales due to expiration. Blood has a shelf life of approx 42 days according to the American Red Cross. However, what make the problem more challenging than milk is the stochastic behaviour of blood supply to the system as compared to the more determistic supply of products like milk. Whole blood is split into different categories including, platelets, RBC and plasma. Each have there own shelf-life and storage requirements. Unfortunately only 5% of eligible donor across the globe donate blood. This highlights the rish humans are faced today. As it has been forecasted the rise of requirement of blood due to various disease year-on-year.
# // REQUIREMENT OF THE PROJECT //
# This analysis will help researchers to understand the social and behavioural drivers for why peoplee donate to begin with. How to increase the number of healthy volunteers.
# // AIM OF  PROJECT //
# To bulid a model which can identify who is more likely to dinate blood again.
# // MODELS IMPLEMENTED //
# 1. Logistic Regression 2. Support Vector Machine 3. Random Forest 4. Decision Tree 5. MLP Classifier
